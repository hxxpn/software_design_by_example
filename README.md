# Code and Breakdown of: Software Design by Example
Exercises, code and remarks on Software Design by Example book

## Introduction and Motivation

Software desing by Example is a great resource to understand programming better. It is intended for junior to mid level developers mostly from what I have gathered.
It serves as a way to expand your understanding of Python, how different libraries and components work. Some might seem like magic or abstract gibberish, but through this book you
can gain sufficient insight about how those decisions are made and how they work.
